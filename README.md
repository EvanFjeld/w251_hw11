The intitial training took about 250 steps before the model started to make more consistent improvement. The duration hovered at around 0 for the first 100 episodes and then jumped to about 25 for the next 150 before making very consistent improvements from 250 to about 550 with a maximum performance of about 200. Then the model's performance falls a little bit before ending about around 150.
