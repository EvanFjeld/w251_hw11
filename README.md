The intitial training took about 250 steps before the model started to make more consistent improvement. The duration hovered at around 0 for the first 100 episodes and then jumped to about 25 for the next 150 before making very consistent improvements from 250 to about 550 with a maximum performance of about 200. Then the model's performance falls a little bit before ending about around 150.

What was the first change you made to the model, and how did ![Uploading initial training.png‚Ä¶]()
it affect the outcome?

The first change


What was the second change you made to the model, and how did it affect the outcome?


What was the third change you made to the model, and how did it affect the outcome?


How is the Epsilon value used in the training? Why does it "decay"?


Explain the purpose of the Gamma (ùõæ) value.
